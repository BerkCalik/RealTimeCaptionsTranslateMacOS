## Tell Me About Yourself (Preferred Direction)
- Start with 10+ years in software development.
- Focus on recent years in React Native / React frontend development.
- Mention fintech, e-commerce, airline domain experience.
- Highlight strengths: scalable architecture, performance, production readiness.
- Close with what I am looking for: impactful product team, strong engineering culture, ownership.

## Common Interview Questions (Guidance)
### Why are you interested in this role?
- I enjoy building user-facing products with real impact.
- I can contribute strongly in React Native / frontend architecture and delivery.
- I am looking for a team where I can combine hands-on development with ownership.

### Why are you leaving / Why did you leave your last role?
- My last company went through downsizing, so my time there ended for business reasons.
- I keep the explanation professional and neutral.
- I focus on what I am looking for next: long-term impact, ownership, and strong engineering culture.

### Why should we hire you?
- Strong React Native + React experience across multiple industries.
- Proven ability to ship production apps and improve architecture/performance.
- Practical communication style and ownership mindset.

### Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?
- Stronger technical ownership / senior IC or tech lead responsibilities.
- Deeper impact on architecture, code quality, and mentoring.
- Building products with high quality and sustainable engineering practices.

## Strengths (Use with Examples)
- Scalable architecture thinking
  - I usually structure projects for maintainability and feature growth, especially in React Native apps.
- Performance optimization mindset
  - I pay attention to bottlenecks, rendering behavior, and production issues early.
- Ownership and delivery
  - I focus on shipping working solutions, not only writing code.
- Practical communication
  - I explain trade-offs clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Weaknesses / Development Areas (Safe Interview Version)
- I can spend extra time polishing implementation details.
  - Improvement: I timebox polishing and align earlier on scope and impact.
- I sometimes take on too much ownership myself.
  - Improvement: I delegate earlier and communicate risks sooner.
- I used to jump into implementation quickly when requirements were ambiguous.
  - Improvement: I now clarify assumptions and edge cases earlier.

## Behavioral Story Bank (STAR - Compact)

### 1) Performance Improvement in High-Traffic App (Passgage)
- Situation: A high-traffic HR super app needed better performance and smoother user experience.
- Task: Improve responsiveness and reduce performance pain points in a production app.
- Action: The project was JavaScript-heavy, poorly structured, and had no proper state management, which caused unnecessary re-renders. I led improvements by moving the codebase toward TypeScript, introducing feature-based organization, implementing Redux Toolkit for state management, and applying memoization patterns to reduce re-render issues.
- Result: The app became more predictable, easier to maintain, and performance issues caused by unnecessary re-renders were reduced. (Add concrete metrics if available.)
- Use for: challenge, performance, impact, debugging, prioritization

### 2) Building a Sustainable Mobile Architecture (Passgage)
- Situation: The project needed a maintainable structure for ongoing feature development.
- Task: Create a scalable architecture and improve release reliability.
- Action: As the lead, I needed to protect engineering standards while the project evolved. I introduced a feature-based architecture, improved project organization, used Redux Toolkit as a standard state management approach, and strengthened code quality controls with pre-commit hooks for ESLint, SonarCloud integration, and GitHub Actions checks in PRs for ESLint and Prettier. I also supported CI/CD and monitoring practices (App Center, Sentry).
- Result: Development standards became more consistent, code review quality improved, and the release process became more reliable and maintainable. (Add team/product outcomes if available.)
- Use for: architecture, ownership, leadership, quality, long-term thinking

### 3) Fintech App From Scratch (Ruul)
- Situation: A fintech mobile app was being built from scratch.
- Task: Help build a production-ready application with scalable state management.
- Action: Implemented key parts of the app with React Native and Redux Toolkit, focusing on clean structure, testability, and Scrum collaboration.
- Result: Contributed to a solid foundation for a fintech product with scalable state management.
- Use for: greenfield project, architecture decisions, teamwork, fintech experience

### 4) Launching and Scaling for Multiple Markets (Vivense)
- Situation: Mobile app development and launch for Turkey and UK markets required scalable architecture.
- Task: Deliver features reliably while keeping codebase maintainable.
- Action: Applied feature-based architecture, used TypeScript/Redux Toolkit, and integrated CMS-driven homepage and Sentry monitoring.
- Result: Helped support multi-market launch and ongoing product evolution.
- Use for: scalability, production readiness, international launch, monitoring

### 5) Native Module Integration Challenge (Inveon)
- Situation: E-commerce apps needed payment-related integration via Masterpass SDK.
- Task: Integrate SDK functionality into React Native applications.
- Action: I solved this by developing both sides of the integration: the Java Android native side for the Masterpass SDK integration and the React Native JavaScript side that consumed the native module. Then I connected the module cleanly into the app flow.
- Result: Enabled required payment integration capabilities in production apps.
- Use for: technical challenge, native integration, problem solving, platform knowledge

### 6) Working Across Different Product Domains (Tmob)
- Situation: Worked across airline platforms, a super app, and banking product improvements.
- Task: Contribute effectively in different codebases and business contexts.
- Action: Adapted quickly to different stacks (Next.js, React+Vite, React Native) and collaborated on practical product improvements.
- Result: Delivered contributions across B2C, B2B, mobile, and web environments.
- Use for: adaptability, fast ramp-up, cross-domain experience, teamwork
